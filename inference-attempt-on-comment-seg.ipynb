Madam Clerk let's go ahead and move on to items on our agenda. We have first with us the reordered agenda would include the sugary sweetened beverage tax update. Madam Clerk could you please read item number two into the record. Agenda item 2 sugary beverage tax update for briefing and discussion. Thank you so much and I see with us our friends from the community advisory board. I want to welcome to the dais here Jen Jennifer Moss. Hello Jen good to see you co-chair of the sugary sweetened beverage tax advisory board. Tanika Thompson Byrd also co-chair of the sugary sweetened beverage tax advisory board and Bridgette our friend and my neighbor who works here at the city of Seattle from the office of sustainability and the environment. Did I miss anybody who is joining us to present today? No that's it. Okay wonderful well I hear Bridgette and I see Tanika off mute as well and I see Jen so with that I just want to say thank you. It's been a pleasure to work with all of you as we crafted the 2023 and 2024 biannual budget. The community advisory board always sends to our team a list of their priorities early. They send it to the full council and the mayor as well and it was it was a true privilege and honor to be able to work with you in these really tough times to make sure that we could continue the commitments that we have made to the community to ensure that public health and the community's health was paramount in these times and while the sugary sweetened beverage tax revenues were down we were able to supplement some of the increased need and the additional revenue necessary with the higher than anticipated revenue from jumpstarts progressive payroll tax for a short period of time. We were able to do that recognizing the immense need in these moments where folks are still dealing with economic insecurity, housing insecurity and food insecurity but we also at the same time recognize that the sugary sweetened beverage tax was never intended to buoy the total amount of revenue. It was a public health approach to try to get folks to consume less sugary sweetened beverages so looking forward to talking with you about the investments that we're making and of course also talking about how we continue to sustain investments in these core public health programs while we hopefully see fewer people consuming sugary sweetened beverages so that we can improve their health individual health as well as improve the population's health through greater program investment and resources. So with that I'll turn it over to you all Bridget, Tanika and Jen welcome again and would be remiss if I didn't say thank you to Farideh Cuevas from our staff who has been staffing us on all things health and food security for the last five years and for her work on the budget and cab connection as well so thanks so much. I'll turn it over to you. Thank you so much.\n",

      "FULL COMMENT: The last time the cab presented to a council committee was in 2018 and this was the first year of SBT implementation and when the cab developed its first budget recommendations. Since it has been five years we wanted to take this opportunity to present on the following topics. Some quick background on the SBT, role of the cab, highlights from programs supported by SBT revenue and some important policy considerations and recommendations about the SBT fund. We welcome your questions at the end and Bridgette Igoe OSC food policy advisor is here to help us field your questions and all things that she helps us with. A quick note on the topic we won't be addressing today and that is the SBT evaluation which is addressing assessing the health and economic impacts of the tax itself and the five year evaluation is managed by the city auditor in partnership with Public Health Department and UW. We're aware that there are some reports coming soon in the meantime we direct you to the cab webpage which has lots of details and information on past evaluation reports. So first some background on the sweetened beverage tax. The SBT started in 2018 making this the fifth year of implementation. The tax was designed to improve the health of Seattle residents by reducing the sales and consumption of sugary drinks. Sugary drinks are the largest source of sugar in the American diet and a major contributor to poor health outcomes. The tax is levied on distributors of sugary beverages within Seattle city limits. The SBT is not a sales tax and that is by design. Sales taxes are paid by consumers at the register. This tax is paid by the distributors of the sugary drinks. The thinking behind this type of tax is the distributors will pass the cost on cost of the tax on to the consumers in the form of higher shelf prices and that that sticker shock will deter people from buying the product. Also SBT raises revenue from these programs that increase food security, access to healthy food, and supports children's health and early learning. So in addition to the nuts and bolts of the tax I want to take a moment to remind us all of the influential community advocacy that shaped the design and implementation of the SBT. In 2017 when the city started to consider a new tax on sugary beverages, community organizing, especially in South Seattle, helped turn what could otherwise be a regressive tax into one that benefits low income communities and communities of color. We fought hard to make sure that if SBT was passed it would include spending guidance so that revenue would be equitably reinvested in communities most impacted by the tax and most burdened by food and nutrition insecurity and disparities in educational opportunities. We also worked hard to ensure that SBT spending was used to expand food security and prenatal to three programs and services and protect the revenue from being swapped for other uses. Now that was a promise that I personally went out and made to the community with other people from my organization, Got Green, and by policymakers at the time. This legacy the CAB continues to uphold. I'm sorry, this is the legacy. The CAB continues to uphold, and I'm thankful for the support we've had from current City Council and leaders like Councilmember Mosqueda. Let's talk about the role of the CAB. For five years and counting, the CAB has had a significant role in SBT implementation. Our official role as defined in the ordinance that created the SBT is to advise and make recommendations to the Mayor and City Council on the programs and services supported by the SBT revenues. Since 2017, we've issued 24 letters of recommendations on SBT spending, SBT budget legislation, City grantmaking guidelines, and program implementation. We take our role seriously, and through community engagement and our own experiences, we aim to be a voice of community priorities, centering those most impacted by health and education inequities. So this is an overview of the current CAB roster. The CAB consists of 11 members who all care deeply about race and justice, social justice. Members are appointed by the Mayor or City Council into one of four position types, food access, community, public health, and early learning. While we are appointed to specific areas, the beauty of the CAB is that we are highly interdisciplinary and understand how food security, health, and child development are all interrelated topics and that the disparities are rooted in racism, socioeconomic, and environmental injustices. While we are all different in our experiences and expertise, as CAB, as a CAB, we aim to speak with one voice. Our process and approach to developing recommendations together is grounded in a set of shared values, decision-making criteria, and budget principles. These are all publicly available like our monthly meetings. We intentionally designed these tools to affirm our focus of racial justice, social equity, and community identified priorities.\n",

      "FULL COMMENT: So this is a snapshot of the prenatal to three program and services supported by SBT. The outcomes from our 2021 annual report were where we encourage you to read more about all of these programs. SBT supports a variety of prenatal to three investments managed by DEEL, and you all know what that is. I guess I don't need to spell it out. Going down this list, investments include a new grants program co-designed by the CAB that supports culturally relevant services delivered to grassroots organizations, the Child Care Assistance Program, or CCAP, subsidy program, critical life-changing supports for low-income children with disabilities and developmental delays, evidence-based home visiting programs, high-quality coaching for birth to age providers, and supports for home-based child care providers. This is the diverse constellation of community-based organizations that DEEL and its other institutional partners work with to deliver prenatal to three services to Seattle residents. Again, this is based on 2021 programs.\n",

      "FULL COMMENT: This is a snapshot of the food security programs and services supported by SBT. These outcomes are also from 2021. As you can see, SBT supports a variety of food programs managed by DAWN, OSC, and HSD. These include the Popular Food Equity Fund, co-designed by the CAB, which invests in community-led work that contributes to an equitable and sustainable local food system. Fresh Bucks, which provides $40 per month in electronic benefits that enrolled households can use to buy fruits and vegetables. Expanding eligibility for Fresh Bucks was a major point of advocacy for the community coalitions as SBT was being passed. Food banks and meal programs. I'm sorry, hold on a second. Okay. Food banks and meal programs, which serve some of our most food-insecure and vulnerable neighbors. Farm-to-Priest programs, which serve some of our most food-insecure and vulnerable neighbors. Farm-to-Priest School, which brings sustainability, grown foods from local farmers to local preschools. Healthy Food in Schools, which supplements the school meals program. This is the incredible list of community-based organizations that were supported by SBT in 2021 to deliver food-insecure programs. I am so grateful to these organizations for all their work to deliver these food programs.\n",

      "FULL COMMENT: So, we already made the point that food security and prenatal to three programs and services are essential to a healthy, thriving, and equitable Seattle. Over the years, the CAB has identified needs and opportunities to enhance these programs. For example, we know hunger relief programs are trying to increase their offerings of culturally responsive foods. The Developmental Bridge Program would benefit from more inclusive outreach. We know that food security and prenatal bridge program would benefit from more inclusive outreach. The Food Equity Fund receives funding requests that are four to five times more than the ongoing annual allocation. Fresh Bucks has a wait list and needs more customer service support. An updated food action plan coming out later this year has identified new actions to foster an equitable and resilient local food system. However, the SBT Fund alone cannot meet the current and future needs. So, this is a slide from the City's November Economic and Revenue Update. Notice the three-year shortfall in the SBT Fund. We've been told to generally expect a downturn in SBT from 2022 to 2026. Again, the revenue declines are largely driven by a reduction in syrup sales, which is an indication that return to work and restaurants have not bounced back as quickly as potentially expected. In the last budget process, given the shortfall in the SBT Fund, cuts to critical prenatal tertiary and food security programs were on the table. We worked with departments to identify strategic reductions that would not impact direct services for residents in need. But this means the current SBT spending plan is as bare bones as possible. In other words, there's nowhere else to cut except direct services. Thankfully, when City Council received the dire economic and revenue forecast in November, instead of taking more cuts, Councilmember Mosqueda and colleagues sponsored a council budget action and transferred 1.2 million jumpstart funds to the SBT Fund in 2023 and 2024. Councilmember Mosqueda, you know what that meant to the CAB and community, and we continue to be grateful for your values-driven leadership. But here's the thing. If we face 2025 with the current forecast and the SBT Fund's planning revenue is zero, and the 1.2 million jumpstart allocation ends, there will be another shortfall. So we need to plan ahead. We've already experienced that SBT revenue is down due to reductions in syrup sales and a sluggish activity downtown. But there are some structural issues with SBT as well.\n",

      "FULL COMMENT: Thank you, Seattle. Okay, so we have no in-person commenters signed up, so we'll go straight to remote speakers and everyone will have two minutes to speak and we'll start with Emma Weil. Please correct my mispronunciation. Thank you. Go ahead. Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to testify today on item D3. My name is Emma Weil and I am a senior policy analyst at Upturn, a nonprofit organization in Washington, D.C. that works to advance justice and use of technology. I'm here to testify about Seattle Police's use of mobile device forensics tools, or MDFTs, based on our report, Mass Extraction, which is the most comprehensive report of how police use MDFTs. These tools allow police to search your cell phone for years' worth of texts, photos, location data, online search history, and more. Crucially, at no point in human history have we casually stored so much information about ourselves in one place, making MDFTs a significant expansion of law enforcement power. Given this, we believe the council should, at minimum, move to ban police consent searches of cell phones in Seattle, if not all consent searches outright. We found that police commonly rely on people's consent to search cell phones instead of getting a warrant. This means there's no judicial oversight or legal limitations on the scope of the search or limits on how the data is later used. Between 2018 and 2019, nearly one-third of phones the Seattle Police Department searched were obtained through consent and not having a warrant. But consent searches are legal fiction. The Supreme Court has held that consent is illegitimate if it is coerced by explicit or implicit means. But the notion that someone can actually feel free to walk away from an interaction ignores reality, especially for people of color who face increased threats of potentially deadly police violence. Recent data from California's Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board shows that 95 percent of individuals consent to a search when asked by an officer. Additionally, there is almost never informed consent in the context of cell phone searches. People may know that there is sensitive information on their phones, but it is impossible to mentally keep track of every record on one's phone. Further, MDFTs can extract and analyze data that someone does not even know about, like metadata, meaning people cannot fully know what they're consenting to. Banning consent searches is not a perfect solution, as it's easy for law enforcement to obtain a search warrant. But banning consent searches of cell phones can help limit police discretion, limit the coercive power of police, and begin to rein in SPD's use of MDFTs. Accordingly, the council should, at minimum, ban the use of consent searches of cell phones, if not all consent searches outright. Thank you. Thank you very much. Our next speaker is Cynthia Spies. Hi, I'm Cynthia Spies, an independent security researcher and District 6 resident. My comments are regarding all six surveillance technologies. I sent written public comments via email, which lists recommendations that have not yet been addressed by either the existing surveillance impact reports or the CTO's letter. Please recall that the city intentionally ordered the groups of retroactive surveillance technology reviews, such as the later groups, for incrementally more concerning, complex, otherwise difficult. Since this is the last large group, then these would therefore be the most in need of your scrutiny and oversight via amendments. Many of these technologies are highly privacy-invasive. Geo-time, computer cell phone and mobile device extraction tools, covert cameras and location trackers should all be limited only to cases that are of a violent or serious offense. Their use should be proportional to the crime. Across the board, there needs to be a requirement for legal representation for all the consent-based use of any of these tools, and a ban on both predictive policing and biometric tools, such as face, gait or voice analysis, using these systems or their data. Additionally, SPD is using at least one tool that is from a company, Celebrite, which is linked to human rights abuses in multiple authoritarian countries. These require the divestment from Celebrite. More protections are needed for victims of domestic violence, which could be perpetrated by an SPD employee. Please explicitly add a provision that the use of these technologies, except pursuant to that defined in the final CER, exposes the individual to criminal or civil liability. Stop the militarization and weaponization of SPD by prohibiting mounting of weapons to any ROV with the intent to harm or kill a living being, and divest from buying ROVs from companies that are military manufacturers or defense contractors. Many of the public's questions on the covert cameras, location trackers, ROVs and crash data retrieval tools are unanswered because Seattle IT didn't accept questions during the second public engagement meeting. This is a disservice to the public and highlights that the city cares more about appearances and keeping the status quo instead of actually listening and collaborating with residents. I urge council members to review the emails I sent, which have more details. Thank you. Thank you very much. And our last speaker that signed up is Jennifer Lee. Good morning, Chair Nelson and members of the committee. My name is Jennifer Lee, and I'm the tech policy lead at the ACLU of Washington. I'm also co-chair of the community surveillance working group. I'm commenting on the six SPD surveillance technologies under review. We appreciate the consideration of the working group's recommendations, but believe that the council bills for each technology need to be updated to fully reflect those recommendations and address serious privacy and equity concerns. For example, the ACLU of Washington is concerned about the use of computer, cell phone, and mobile device extraction tools by SPD to surveil and ultimately chill constitutionally protected First Amendment activities concerning religion, expression, and assembly. We recommend a prohibition on the use of consent searches with these extraction tools as consent searches create an inherent power imbalance and information asymmetry between law enforcement and members of the public. Consent agreements also generally do not define adequate parameters limiting the phone search, so police have ample discretion about what data they extract with these tools, the scope of data they extract, and what they do with that data. We know that SPD heavily relies on consent agreements to deploy MDFTs. Any consent process is unlikely to adequately fix the information deficit, especially in the absence of legal counsel. Additionally, for all of these technologies, there needs to be a prohibition on the use of these tools with biometric technologies for predictive policing and for dragnet social media analysis. We are concerned that the appendices in each council budget do not adequately address the working group's recommendations. In many of these appendices, there are claims that the SIR addresses the working group's recommendations, but in many cases the SIR actually falls short. Lastly, there are many outstanding questions on undercover cameras, tracking devices, remotely operated vehicles, and crash data. We have submitted detailed written comments with recommendations on each of the technologies, and we ask that you adopt all of these recommendations in order to mitigate privacy and civil liberties concerns. Thank you for your consideration.\n",

      "FULL COMMENT: Thank you. The February 14, 2023 meeting of the Public Safety and Human Services Committee will come to order. It is 9.35 a.m. I'm Lisa Herbold, chair of the committee. Would the clerk please call the roll. Councilmember Mosqueda. Present. Councilmember Nelson. Present. Councilmember Pedersen. Present. Vice Chair Lewis. Present. Chair Herbold. Here. Five present. Thank you so much. So just a quick rundown on today's agenda. We have two items on the agenda after public comment. The first is a presentation on the Seattle Police Department 2022 Crime Report released last week. And the second is a presentation on all of the upcoming 2023 Human Services Department Notice of Funding Availability. So those are just the opportunities to fund services to the community arising from the major lines of business of the Human Services Department. So with that, we will now approve our agenda for our committee meeting. If there is no objection, our committee agenda will be adopted. Seeing and hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. At this time, we're going to move into public comment. I'll moderate the public comment in the following manner. Each speaker has two minutes to speak. I'll alternate between virtual and in-person public commenters. I'll call on each speaker by name and in order in which they registered on the Council's website in a sign-in form. If you have not yet registered to speak but would like to, you can sign up before the end of the public comment session. Once I call a speaker's name, if you are using the virtual option, you'll hear a prompt. And once you've heard that prompt, please press star 6 to unmute yourself. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item on the agenda which you are addressing. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. And once the speaker hears the chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up your public comments. If speakers do not end their comments at the end of the allotted time provided, the speaker's mic will be muted after 10 seconds to allow us to hear from the next speaker. Once you've completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line. And we encourage you, if you want to continue following the meeting, to do so via the Seattle Channel or the listening options that are listed on the agenda. We've got 11 people signed up for public comment this morning. Nine of those individuals are going to be testifying virtually and two in person. And I'm going to start with the two in-person folks. So I'm going to call names two at a time. And we'll start with Marguerite Richard. And Marguerite Richard will be followed by Azhené Smith. Good morning, everyone. Is the mic on now? Well, anyway, testing 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. And I've already lost some seconds asking me whether or not it was on or off. Thank you. If you mind restarting the clock. Okay. So you have crime on there. And I think the chief is supposed to make a report. He's not in this building right now, per se. I put Tyree Nichols on there because he is an indigenous black male that was gunned down. And I feel like if it affects one like that, it affects us all. That's how I jumped in on crime. I don't understand why we're always the focal point of things like that. Even in this city, with all the years that I have spoken out about issues surrounding our protection. I'll just give you a little scenario about yesterday. I was here to get some information. I went to the fourth floor, the third floor and the sixth floor. Some minions came out on the sixth floor. And then on the fourth floor, a guard came and stretched his neck out. I was like, what's he doing up here? He said, well, they have some boxes that need to be delivered. But to me, it looks suspicious. Like, okay, I'm here. I'm not doing nothing except for I'm on business. And is it your business when I'm here on business? Okay. We're here to eradicate all this stuff that will create a crime and hostility in our community. And that's what it does. We're not supposed to be intimidated. The Bible said, I will fear no evil, but thou art with me. I don't know what happened the day where he was getting the beat down. But it's all over the nation as to what they do to us at any, any given day, like they say, given Sunday, whatever day it is, they use to intimidate us and create hostility in our community. Thank you, Mr. Shard. Our next speaker is Azhané Smith. And I apologize if I mispronounced your name. And the speaker will be followed by Jocelyn Siska. Yeah, my name is Azhané Smith. I'm going to speak on crime. And I'm also going to speak on the, I guess, human services funding, I guess around that part. Crime, I feel like there's a lot of crime where I grew up from, which is the south end of Seattle, also in the central district of Seattle, and also downtown Seattle. I also feel like there should be more funding for, like my aunt says, indigenous black people or black people in the city of Seattle. So we don't have to reach or feel like violence is the only key or participating or selling drugs in our community is our only gatekeep to succeed in society. I also want to say, I would rather you rehabilitate and ask the people who are on drugs and ask the people who are homeless, what they need, and come to it at a therapeutic standpoint, instead of, I guess, pushing them to the side like you don't care about them. Because what I feel like is the city of the Seattle does not care about its people at all, whether they're on drugs, and whether they are in the lower class. So I'm asking people who have the power to fund that to do your job. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Jacqueline Siskoff, followed by Shavinis Gudlav Violetti. Jacqueline, or Jocelyn? Siska? Hello. This is Jacqueline Siska. This testimony is related to the agenda item crime report. I'm speaking today as a parent of children who attended John Sanford International Elementary School in Wallingford, a school which is located near the Pasadena Cammon on the Washtenaw right of way, directly under I-5, just north of the Montlake Canal. We've been watching this ongoing tragedy unfold here for years. There have been fires, murders, drug dealing, all within a stone's throw of a community school. Several houses have been burned down on the street, and on Monday, several car windows were smashed. I can see on the crime report presentation that this area in particular is one of the more dense spots for gun violence in North Seattle. A visit in November by a local nonprofit showed only six people actively living within the encampment. Now, Washtenaw has quoted 25 to 30 people. The encampment has grown significantly during the last few months, and there is clearly a large amount of illegal dumping, all while the King County Regional Homelessness Authority has said that this encampment is next on their priority list. Following many conversations with Washtenaw, Washington State Police, and the RHA, we know that the RHA is the entity responsible for closing the encampment using funds provided by the state. We heard that they were working on the site, but we don't have any timelines, and we're concerned that the situation is getting worse for all involved. We're a compassionate group with focus on the education and safety of our children. We have explained to our kids that people living under this highway near their school are there through no fault of their own, and our local government is able to meet their needs. I'm asking for the city council to step in with regards to this site. So far, the city has not taken action due to the encampment being on Washtenaw right of way. It is not accessible for the city to sit by and watch as the encampment becomes bigger, more dangerous for those inside, those who live within this neighborhood, and the students and staff at John Stanford International School. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker that is signed in but is shown as not present is Shrivnas Gudlabetli. And not seeing a change in the not present status, we'll go down to the next speaker that is showing present and signed in. That is Eli Hachor. And Eli will be followed by Tarul Kodtripathy. Eli? And if you have not yet, Eli, please hit star six. Still showing you. Oh, almost got you off the mute there. Star six, please. There you go. Perfect. There we go. Okay. Sorry about that. Hi. Sorry. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. My name is Eli Hachor. And I'm also a father or a parent of a fourth grade student that attends John Stanford Elementary School. Jackie did explain and describe the encampment. But I just reiterate that, you know, over the last year, I've seen it double and now probably almost triple in size and the amount of people living there. And it's become really a ticking time bomb in the past four or five months. We've seen three gun deaths, violent crimes, rampant drug use. And then just like last week when we had a chance to give public comment to the RHA for immediate action, the night that next night or that night, the encampment caught on fire because of fireworks. And then a couple days later in Chinatown off of I-5, another encampment caught fire where they discovered a meth lab. Obviously, you know, guns, drugs, weapons, money. So it's clear that these are becoming more and more dangerous. All the responses that we get essentially address majority of the language used is addressing the homelessness situation. And as a parent and who's someone who obviously sees the safety of children being the priority here, I see most of that language geared towards what they say they are doing to address the encampment. I just unfortunately have become numb to the sort of lip service that essentially feels like it doesn't get anywhere. We received an email from WSDOT, from Brian Nelson saying that nobody residing in an encampment possesses any immediate public threat to safety, which you'd have to be insane, honestly, to make a statement like that at this point, given all that's been taking place in these encampments. And so we, I'd like to ask the city council or anyone with a background to please help step in and address the situation, address the safety of the children first. Like Jackie said, or anyone, I'm sure you'll hear from others like we care about the homeless scenario, but this is about kids in this particular encampment. And, you know, I appreciate any help from the city council. Thank you. Our next speaker is Tarul Code Tripathi. This speaker is showing as not present. If that status changes, I will go back to hear from the speaker. But moving on, we've got Ashley Cappell followed by Margaret Holt. Ashley. I thank you for your time today. My name is Ashley Cappell. I'm a Seattle resident and also a mother to a six-year-old who attended John Stanford International School. This is my second time in a week having to testify to our, and honestly, you can hear emotion in my voice right now because I'm pleading for you to help us address the crime that's putting imminent risk to our children. Lastly, Council Peterson's office, I want to give kudos to them for really taking this seriously and advocating with us and on our behalf as community members. But I really ask this committee who I see within your scope is to hold accountable our municipal, regional, state, and federal agencies to do what they need to do for public safety. And I'm also addressing the encampment near John Stanford International School. As Jackie Siska said, this is an encampment on Washington State property. Therefore, the Washington State Department of Transportation, the Washington State Patrol, KCRJ are all right now the ones responsible for clearing this. But honestly, we can't wait for them anymore. We need your help working with them, advocating with them, and making it not a choice to clear this as soon as possible for the safety of our children and our community. But it has to happen. The fires, the gun violence. So this is about the crime. It is, I know the recent gun violence that has happened, the murder that happened in that camp is the responsibility of our Seattle Police Department. I want to see accountability to what's happening in this camp, please, I ask you. And so please, you know, continue to do your jobs as we elected you to do. And I thank you for your time today. And I hope that we can get clearer timelines. As Eli mentioned, these timelines are not clear. There's no clear state of action. The focus is that these finding long term residency for these homeless people is more important than our children's imminent safety. And I please ask you to do something about this. Thank you. Our speakers, numbered seven through 15 are all showing as not present. I see many of them are here to speak on an item that is not on the agenda. If you are deciding not to speak, because you are recognizing that the caste discrimination legislation is not on the agenda. I appreciate that and say thank you if you're listening. But I will watch to see if the status of any of these people change. And if they do before we end public comment, I will take your comment. Our next speaker is an in person speaker Alex Zimmerman. Zeke Heil. Zeke Heil, my dirty damn Nazi, Gestapo, democracy, fascist, mob and psychopath. My name is Alex Zimmerman. And I stand here like always with my red sign and yellow David star. I want to speak about crime, agenda number one, for my understanding. How we can talk about crime when you guys, nine consul, make a fundamental constitutional criminals. You not show us faces. This is a pure constitutional crime. Is this not a rule of regulation? Nothing. And you're doing this for 10 months. How we can put in jail people who steal candy for five bucks, for example, when you make a constitutional crime and nobody touch you.\n",
