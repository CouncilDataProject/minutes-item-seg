      "Hello Jen good to see you co-chair of the sugary sweetened beverage tax advisory board.\n",
      "Tanika Thompson Byrd also co-chair of the sugary sweetened beverage tax advisory board and Bridgette our friend and my neighbor who works here at the city of Seattle from the office of sustainability and the environment.\n",
      "Did I miss anybody who is joining us to present today?\n",
      "No that's it.\n",
      "Okay wonderful well I hear Bridgette and I see Tanika off mute as well and I see Jen so with that I just want to say thank you.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure to work with all of you as we crafted the 2023 and 2024 biannual budget.\n",
      "The community advisory board always sends to our team a list of their priorities early.\n",
      "They send it to the full council and the mayor as well and it was it was a true privilege and honor to be able to work with you in these really tough times to make sure that we could continue the commitments that we have made to the community to ensure that public health and the community's health was paramount in these times and while the sugary sweetened beverage tax revenues were down we were able to supplement some of the increased need and the additional revenue necessary with the higher than anticipated revenue from jumpstarts progressive payroll tax for a short period of time.\n",
      "We were able to do that recognizing the immense need in these moments where folks are still dealing with economic insecurity, housing insecurity and food insecurity but we also at the same time recognize that the sugary sweetened beverage tax was never intended to buoy the total amount of revenue.\n",
      "It was a public health approach to try to get folks to consume less sugary sweetened beverages so looking forward to talking with you about the investments that we're making and of course also talking about how we continue to sustain investments in these core public health programs while we hopefully see fewer people consuming sugary sweetened beverages so that we can improve their health individual health as well as improve the population's health through greater program investment and resources. So with that I'll turn it over to you all Bridget, Tanika and Jen welcome again and would be remiss if I didn't say thank you to Farideh Cuevas from our staff who has been staffing us on all things health and food security for the last five years and for her work on the budget and cab connection as well so thanks so much.\n",
      "I'll turn it over to you.\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "Good morning council members.\n",
      "Can everyone hear me?\n",
      "We can hear you and you are great to do just audio if you prefer.\n",
      "I just wanted to make sure you knew your video was off as well.\n",
      "Yes my camera is not working unfortunately.\n",
      "We see your lovely logo so that is that is great and and the beautiful slides.\n",
      "Okay thank you councilmember Mosqueda for the invitation to be here today and for being such an amazing champion of community priorities.\n",
      "My name is Tanika Thompson-Byrd.\n",
      "I am a co-chair of the sweetened beverage tax community advisory board or what we call the cab for short.\n",
      "I am a food access organizer with Got Green and I serve in a council-appointed community seat on the cab.\n",
      "We're grateful for your time and consideration today so we can brief you on SBT program investments and raise some important policy issues.\n",
      "Jen and I prepared a slide deck that will take about 25 minutes to go through and then we'll open it up to questions.\n",
      "Jen I'll turn it to you to introduce yourself and get the presentation started.\n",
      "Thanks Tanika and thank you again council members for having us join your committee meeting today.\n",
      "My name is Jen Moss and I am co-chair of the cab with Tanika and I work with WSU extension SNAP-Ed and serve in a mayor-appointed public health seat.\n",
      "So next slide.\n",
      "The last time the cab presented to a council committee was in 2018 and this was the first year of SBT implementation and when the cab developed its first budget recommendations.\n",
      "Since it has been five years we wanted to take this opportunity to present on the following topics.\n",
      "Some quick background on the SBT, role of the cab, highlights from programs supported by SBT revenue and some important policy considerations and recommendations about the SBT fund.\n",
      "We welcome your questions at the end and Bridgette Igoe OSC food policy advisor is here to help us field your questions and all things that she helps us with.\n",
      "A quick note on the topic we won't be addressing today and that is the SBT evaluation which is addressing assessing the health and economic impacts of the tax itself and the five year evaluation is managed by the city auditor in partnership with Public Health Department and UW.\n",
      "We're aware that there are some reports coming soon in the meantime we direct you to the cab webpage which has lots of details and information on past evaluation reports.\n",
      "So first some background on the sweetened beverage tax.\n",
      "The SBT started in 2018 making this the fifth year of implementation.\n",
      "The tax was designed to improve the health of Seattle residents by reducing the sales and consumption of sugary drinks.\n",
      "Sugary drinks are the largest source of sugar in the American diet and a major contributor to poor health outcomes.\n",
      "The tax is levied on distributors of sugary beverages within Seattle city limits.\n",
      "The SBT is not a sales tax and that is by design.\n",
      "Sales taxes are paid by consumers at the register.\n",
      "This tax is paid by the distributors of the sugary drinks.\n",
      "The thinking behind this type of tax is the distributors will pass the cost on cost of the tax on to the consumers in the form of higher shelf prices and that that sticker shock will deter people from buying the product.\n",
      "Also SBT raises revenue from these programs that increase food security, access to healthy food, and supports children's health and early learning.\n",
      "So in addition to the nuts and bolts of the tax I want to take a moment to remind us all of the influential community advocacy that shaped the design and implementation of the SBT.\n",
      "In 2017 when the city started to consider a new tax on sugary beverages, community organizing, especially in South Seattle, helped turn what could otherwise be a regressive tax into one that benefits low income communities and communities of color.\n",
      "We fought hard to make sure that if SBT was passed it would include spending guidance so that revenue would be equitably reinvested in communities most impacted by the tax and most burdened by food and nutrition insecurity and disparities in educational opportunities.\n",
      "We also worked hard to ensure that SBT spending was used to expand food security and prenatal to three programs and services and protect the revenue from being swapped for other uses.\n",
      "Now that was a promise that I personally went out and made to the community with other people from my organization, Got Green, and by policymakers at the time.\n",
      "This legacy the CAB continues to uphold.\n",
      "I'm sorry, this is the legacy.\n",
      "The CAB continues to uphold, and I'm thankful for the support we've had from current City Council and leaders like Councilmember Mosqueda.\n",
      "Let's talk about the role of the CAB.\n",
      "For five years and counting, the CAB has had a significant role in SBT implementation.\n",
      "Our official role as defined in the ordinance that created the SBT is to advise and make recommendations to the Mayor and City Council on the programs and services supported by the SBT revenues.\n",
      "Since 2017, we've issued 24 letters of recommendations on SBT spending, SBT budget legislation, City grantmaking guidelines, and program implementation.\n",
      "We take our role seriously, and through community engagement and our own experiences, we aim to be a voice of community priorities, centering those most impacted by health and education inequities.\n",
      "So this is an overview of the current CAB roster.\n",
      "The CAB consists of 11 members who all care deeply about race and justice, social justice.\n",
      "Members are appointed by the Mayor or City Council into one of four position types, food access, community, public health, and early learning.\n",
      "While we are appointed to specific areas, the beauty of the CAB is that we are highly interdisciplinary and understand how food security, health, and child development are all interrelated topics and that the disparities are rooted in racism, socioeconomic, and environmental injustices.\n",
      "While we are all different in our experiences and expertise, as CAB, as a CAB, we aim to speak with one voice.\n",
      "Our process and approach to developing recommendations together is grounded in a set of shared values, decision-making criteria, and budget principles.\n",
      "These are all publicly available like our monthly meetings.\n",
      "We intentionally designed these tools to affirm our focus of racial justice, social equity, and community identified priorities.\n",
      "We also maintain effective relationships with department staff and city budget office who regularly provide updates, help us navigate the city budget process, and are responsive to our information requests.\n",
      "As Tanika said, we take our role seriously and work from a solid foundation and framework to advise the Mayor and City Council.\n",
      "Never have we transmitted recommendations that weren't carefully considered against our values and principles and broader community context.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "The CAB solid foundation has been critical because we have definitely weathered some volatile times with the SBG.\n",
      "Later in the presentation, we're going to talk more about SBG revenue forecasts, but first let's take a quick look at the history of actual revenues.\n",
      "In its first year, the SBG collected nearly $23 million, even though the city's original forecast was about $15 million.\n",
      "In 2019, revenues remained largely stable, but when 2020 saw a large dip in revenues due to COVID, data available on our annual reports show that during 2020, reported ounces of syrups and concentrates fell approximately 52%.\n",
      "This is definitely linked to COVID-related lockdown measures and business closures.\n",
      "Syrups and concentrates are used in soda fountains at restaurants.\n",
      "Revenues are recovering, but it has been gradual, likely due to downtown being slow to return to pre-pandemic activity.\n",
      "In 2021, the SBG collected just under $19 million, and the November projection for 2022 was $20.4 million.\n",
      "SBG collections for 2022 are not available yet.\n",
      "Tax fillers have until April 30th to report their 2022 taxes.\n",
      "So let's talk about SBT spending plan.\n",
      "Meanwhile, this is an overview of the current SBT spending plan.\n",
      "Add up these expected expenditures, and you get about $21.8 million in planned spending, more than the most recent revenue projection.\n",
      "We will address the implications of this later in our presentation, but first, let's look at what exactly SBT is paying for.\n",
      "So by design, and now according to the Seattle Municipal Hold, SBT revenues must be used to expand food security and prenatal history programs and services.\n",
      "These are incredibly important programs.\n",
      "There's a famous quote that goes something like, the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.\n",
      "That's what we're talking about here.\n",
      "Our city's investment in programs that serve Seattle's low-income babies, toddlers, families with young children, people with disabilities, elders, and even more.\n",
      "It's hard to overstate the importance of food security and prenatal to three programs.\n",
      "Food security is essential to health and well-being.\n",
      "When people don't have enough food, they must or must choose inexpensive foods that are not nutritious.\n",
      "There's a huge impact on their physical and mental health, including increased rates of depression, diabetes, and heart disease.\n",
      "For children, food insecurity impacts their health behavior, health behavior, and readiness to learn in school.\n",
      "Far too many Seattle residents experience food insecurity and hunger.\n",
      "Even before the onset of the pandemic, almost 11% of Seattle adults experienced food insecurity, and there are deep and persistent disparities by race, ethnicity, by income, and for households with children.\n",
      "Due to structural racism, BIPOC households in Seattle are more than four times as likely to experience food insecurity than white and Asian households.\n",
      "It's imperative that a city as wealthy as Seattle, that as a city as wealthy as Seattle, we invest in a range of strategies that not only provide direct services and meet immediate needs, but also policy, system, and environmental changes that address root causes of poverty.\n",
      "On the prenatal to three side, the first year of a child's life are some of the most important in terms of their cognitive, social, and physical development.\n",
      "Early experiences occurring when a child's brain and behavior are being shaped affect a child's ability to learn, to get along with others, and to develop an overall sense of well-being.\n",
      "Unfortunately, not all children have the same positive experiences or opportunities, which can lead to disparities.\n",
      "Social, economic, and environmental factors that have been closely linked to health disparities, Seattle's prenatal to three programs are working to change this.\n",
      "So this is a snapshot of the prenatal to three program and services supported by SBT.\n",
      "The outcomes from our 2021 annual report were where we encourage you to read more about all of these programs.\n",

      "This is the diverse constellation of community-based organizations that DEEL and its other institutional partners work with to deliver prenatal to three services to Seattle residents.\n",

      "As you can see, SBT supports a variety of food programs managed by DAWN, OSC, and HSD.\n",

      "It is recorded that the British actually introduced caste as a part of the divide and rule policy, and when they asked for the caste, they said it was the British who introduced it.\n",

      "The premise for introducing this ordinance we have been hearing are anecdotal evidence.\n",
      "For instance, a quality lab study that was quoted in support of this ordinance has been severely debunked by Carnegie Endowment Research.\n",
      "It said that the survey is not based on a representative sample and raised serious concerns about questions about the generalizability of its findings.\n",
      "Along similar lines, one of the key findings of the Pew Research is that people of lower caste do not think they face discrimination based on caste.\n",

      "Professor Sunil Kumar and Praveen Sinha claim that Cal State's new caste discrimination policy, quote, seeks to define the Hindu religion as including caste and an alleged oppressive and discriminatory caste system as foundational religious tenets and that it singles out students and staff who are Indian and Hindu.\n",
      "Kumar and Sinha don't identify as being members of any caste and they said they fear that their caste identity will be lost to them under the policy.\n",
      "Both professors were born in India and are followers of Hinduism.\n",
      "I will add that my Indian wife's family never had caste identity in their community.\n",

      "You have already been contacted by several Dalit and Bahujan folks, the ones you are claiming to protect and represent, and all of those Dalit Bahujan folks have urged you to not fall for this racist trope.\n",
      "They do not need representation from the likes of Equality Labs, which is an open hate group dedicated to demolishing Hinduism.\n",
      "That is their right.\n",
      "Seattle should not mainstream such hate and such racist trope.\n",
      "As previous scholars have said, those opposing it are not for discrimination, but they want to warn you not to set up a commission or a law that would start to discriminate against yet another minority.\n",

      "Caste in South Asian communities is far removed from the American cultural context and not easy to legislate morally.\n",
      "One of my main concerns is how this law will actually be enforced.\n",
      "There are no universally applicable ways to determine someone's caste.\n",
      "I don't even know my caste.\n",
      "As a South Asian American, is the Seattle City Council going to assign me one?\n",
      "If so, how would they determine my caste?\n",
      "Will you force South Asians to identify that way?\n",
      "And lastly, how will this apply to ethnically mixed people?\n",
      "If the council has not considered these questions, I would urge them to table it until more studies have been conducted as it may have possible ramifications for the very people it claims to help.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",

      "A huge number of lawsuits and counter lawsuits are sure to follow.\n",
      "How do we resolve them?\n",
      "How do we determine someone's caste?\n",
      "And who decides if a person is higher or lower caste?\n",
      "To my Hindu friends, I have the same questions.\n",
      "Caste is a foreign word, and in its insidiousness, all discrimination comes from a place of arrogance and ignorance.\n",
      "While there is little we can do about the former, there is a lot we can do about the latter.\n",
      "So please educate yourself and those around you.\n",
      "Please do not let a few bad words of ignorant individuals cloud your thinking.\n",
      "May we all go from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge.\n",
      "Thank you very much.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "The next speaker is Chitana Wilson.\n",
      "Hi, my name is Chitana, and I strongly urge the Seattle Council to vote no on the caste resolution, again, as it is founded on faulty data.\n",
      "There are several well-documented problems with the Equality Lab survey as laid out in various articles.\n",
      "The quality and data of this report were challenged comprehensively back in 2018 when it was first distributed.\n",
      "More recently, the 2020 survey on Indian Americans by the Seattle Council found that Indian Americans were more likely to be cast in the South Asian population than non-Indian Americans.\n",
      "The study relied on a non-representative snowball sampling method to recruit respondents.\n",
      "Furthermore, respondents who did not disclose a caste identity were dropped from the data set.\n",
      "Therefore, it is likely that the sample did not fully represent the South Asian American population.\n",
      "I would like to call on a caste writer.\n",
      "Caste is rooted in the Hindu scriptures.\n",
      "She is seeking to dismantle Hinduism, and I just want to know if Seattle supports dismantling Hinduism as well.\n",

      "It's very much like CRT thing, which is coming in the year schools, which is going to invite more lawsuits, more discrimination.\n",
      "We're going to create more bad blood among the American citizens.\n",
      "Most of us are coming from immigrants like myself.\n",
      "We are now Americanized.\n",

      "Crime, I feel like there's a lot of crime where I grew up from, which is the south end of Seattle, also in the central district of Seattle, and also downtown Seattle.\n",
      "I also feel like there should be more funding for, like my aunt says, indigenous black people or black people in the city of Seattle.\n",
      "So we don't have to reach or feel like violence is the only key or participating or selling drugs in our community is our only gatekeep to succeed in society.\n",
      "I also want to say, I would rather you rehabilitate and ask the people who are on drugs and ask the people who are homeless, what they need, and come to it at a therapeutic standpoint, instead of, I guess, pushing them to the side like you don't care about them.\n",
      "Because what I feel like is the city of the Seattle does not care about its people at all, whether they're on drugs, and whether they are in the lower class.\n",

      "I'm speaking today as a parent of children who attended John Sanford International Elementary School in Wallingford, a school which is located near the Pasadena Cammon on the Washtenaw right of way, directly under I-5, just north of the Montlake Canal.\n",
      "We've been watching this ongoing tragedy unfold here for years.\n",
      "There have been fires, murders, drug dealing, all within a stone's throw of a community school.\n",
      "Several houses have been burned down on the street, and on Monday, several car windows were smashed.\n",
      "I can see on the crime report presentation that this area in particular is one of the more dense spots for gun violence in North Seattle.\n",
      "A visit in November by a local nonprofit showed only six people actively living within the encampment.\n",
      "Now, Washtenaw has quoted 25 to 30 people.\n",
      "The encampment has grown significantly during the last few months, and there is clearly a large amount of illegal dumping, all while the King County Regional Homelessness Authority has said that this encampment is next on their priority list.\n",
      "Following many conversations with Washtenaw, Washington State Police, and the RHA, we know that the RHA is the entity responsible for closing the encampment using funds provided by the state.\n",
      "We heard that they were working on the site, but we don't have any timelines, and we're concerned that the situation is getting worse for all involved.\n",
      "We're a compassionate group with focus on the education and safety of our children.\n",
      "We have explained to our kids that people living under this highway near their school are there through no fault of their own, and our local government is able to meet their needs.\n",
      "I'm asking for the city council to step in with regards to this site.\n",
      "So far, the city has not taken action due to the encampment being on Washtenaw right of way.\n",
      "It is not accessible for the city to sit by and watch as the encampment becomes bigger, more dangerous for those inside, those who live within this neighborhood, and the students and staff at John Stanford International School.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Our next speaker that is signed in but is shown as not present is Shrivnas Gudlabetli.\n",

      "That is Eli Hachor.\n",
      "And Eli will be followed by Tarul Kodtripathy.\n",
      "Eli?\n",

      "Hi.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Good morning, everybody.\n",
      "My name is Eli Hachor.\n",
      "And I'm also a father or a parent of a fourth grade student that attends John Stanford Elementary School.\n",
      "Jackie did explain and describe the encampment.\n",
      "But I just reiterate that, you know, over the last year, I've seen it double and now probably almost triple in size and the amount of people living there.\n",
      "And it's become really a ticking time bomb in the past four or five months.\n",
      "We've seen three gun deaths, violent crimes, rampant drug use.\n",
      "And then just like last week when we had a chance to give public comment to the RHA for immediate action, the night that next night or that night, the encampment caught on fire because of fireworks.\n",
      "And then a couple days later in Chinatown off of I-5, another encampment caught fire where they discovered a meth lab.\n",
      "Obviously, you know, guns, drugs, weapons, money.\n",
      "So it's clear that these are becoming more and more dangerous.\n",
      "All the responses that we get essentially address majority of the language used is addressing the homelessness situation.\n",
      "And as a parent and who's someone who obviously sees the safety of children being the priority here, I see most of that language geared towards what they say they are doing to address the encampment.\n",
      "I just unfortunately have become numb to the sort of lip service that essentially feels like it doesn't get anywhere.\n",
      "We received an email from WSDOT, from Brian Nelson saying that nobody residing in an encampment possesses any immediate public threat to safety, which you'd have to be insane, honestly, to make a statement like that at this point, given all that's been taking place in these encampments.\n",
      "And so we, I'd like to ask the city council or anyone with a background to please help step in and address the situation, address the safety of the children first.\n",
      "Like Jackie said, or anyone, I'm sure you'll hear from others like we care about the homeless scenario, but this is about kids in this particular encampment.\n",
      "And, you know, I appreciate any help from the city council.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Our next speaker is Tarul Code Tripathi.\n",
      "This speaker is showing as not present.\n",
      "If that status changes, I will go back to hear from the speaker.\n",
      "But moving on, we've got Ashley Cappell followed by Margaret Holt.\n",
      "Ashley.\n",
      "I thank you for your time today.\n",
      "My name is Ashley Cappell.\n",
      "I'm a Seattle resident and also a mother to a six-year-old who attended John Stanford International School.\n",
